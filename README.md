**CyaniTalk** is a diversified, cross-platform social client built with Flutter. It bridges the gap between **Misskey** (decentralized micro-blogging) and **Flarum** (structured community forums), offering a unified experience for both casual social interaction and deep technical discussions.

Designed with a **Responsive Shell**, CyaniTalk adapts seamlessly between mobile (iOS/Android) and desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux) environments, providing native-tier features like real-time streaming and advanced administrative tools.
